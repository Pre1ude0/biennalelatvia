                    <p>
                        The exhibition focuses on the military defence of the
                        Latvian state from the perspectives of architecture,
                        landscape and urban planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In response to the recent geopolitical events, work is
                        underway to strengthen the country's physical borders to
                        prevent a massive military attack by land. To this end,
                        various defence elements, each with a specific location
                        and function, are deployed in a coherent system along
                        the country's eastern external border. These include
                        barbed wire, fences, anti-tank "hedgehogs", concrete
                        "dragon's teeth", anti-tank trenches and mines. Other
                        military defence measures in Latvia include public
                        information and training on how to deal with crises and
                        war, as well as large-scale military mobilisation – the
                        activation of reservists and the National Guard, and the
                        reintroduction of compulsory military service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this exhibition, we want to highlight the specific
                        conditions of Latvia’s geographical situation, which
                        force its population to live under the constant threat
                        of attack. It aims to offer the international
                        architectural discourse a study of the relationship
                        between military defence and spatial planning in the
                        Latvian context. We want to invite architects to
                        evaluate their role in the defence of the country and to
                        draw attention to the impact of defence measures on the
                        environment and landscape identity. On the other hand,
                        we involve policy makers and military defence
                        specialists in the conversation, encouraging them to pay
                        attention to the physical footprint of defence
                        strategies on Latvian territory and the emotional impact
                        on the country's population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        National defence is an ongoing process that we must
                        learn to accept and acknowledge. It should not make us
                        fear the proximity of war, but reassure us that we are
                        safe.

                        The exhibition focuses on the military defence of the
                        Latvian state from the perspectives of architecture,
                        landscape and urban planning.

                        In response to the recent geopolitical events, work is
                        underway to strengthen the country's physical borders to
                        prevent a massive military attack by land. To this end,
                        various defence elements, each with a specific location
                        and function, are deployed in a coherent system along
                        the country's eastern external border. These include
                        barbed wire, fences, anti-tank "hedgehogs", concrete
                        "dragon's teeth", anti-tank trenches and mines. Other
                        military defence measures in Latvia include public
                        information and training on how to deal with crises and
                        war, as well as large-scale military mobilisation – the
                        activation of reservists and the National Guard, and the
                        reintroduction of compulsory military service.

                        With this exhibition, we want to highlight the specific
                        conditions of Latvia’s geographical situation, which
                        force its population to live under the constant threat
                        of attack. It aims to offer the international
                        architectural discourse a study of the relationship
                        between military defence and spatial planning in the
                        Latvian context. We want to invite architects to
                        evaluate their role in the defence of the country and to
                        draw attention to the impact of defence measures on the
                        environment and landscape identity. On the other hand,
                        we involve policy makers and military defence
                        specialists in the conversation, encouraging them to pay
                        attention to the physical footprint of defence
                        strategies on Latvian territory and the emotional impact
                        on the country's population.

                    <p>
                        National defence is an ongoing process that we must
                        learn to accept and acknowledge. It should not make us
                        fear the proximity of war, but reassure us that we are
                        safe.
